d2001: New splash screen

----------------------------------------------------------------------
04/15'20
This went into production as V1.0.05

02/30'20
Fixed so that the LineupCard ListView showed highleght color.
Forced Light view with UIUserInterfaceStyle = Light in info.plist.

#2002.02: Use 'using
Use 'using' with HttpWebRequest.GetResonse.
I found that starting new game a second time was timing out.
This was new... I saw a remark online that suggested it could be  server-specific,
and I have just switched to WinHost!


#2002.01: Overhaul of return logic...
...with PopModalAsync.
Please search code tag in EN


1/6'20
This starts Git branch dev.

8/12'19
'Final' review... made cosmetic changes and hopefully fixed posn picker behavior
in iOS. Must test in iOS.


7/26'19
Bolded text in Results.
Blurb about fielding at top of Fielding Profile pag.


7/19'19..7/23'19
Revamped extra innings handling & the << and >> buttons.
I think it's tight now... tested with temp debug code (search 'extra innings')


7/18'19
Fixed bug with issue 1907.01, where btnGo was being enabled too soon while
EShowResults was still running. See comment in code for more detail

Fielding profile disk is implemented. Showing fielding skill string, along with 
explanation of 0..6.


7/16'19
Running well. Fixed enablement of buttons and fixed Move Up & Down so it can't move 
non-batting pitcher, or #9 hitter down.

Started working on Fielding disk... it has a experimental icon on the DISK button, but runs well.


7/15'19
I overhauled to use actual pa (for league and batters) and bfp (for pitchers) i/o
the approximations that I had been using. Now, I compute adjusted pa & bfp by 
subtracting ibb and and estmate of sac bunt attempts. For batters and league, the estimated
sac bunt attempts is based on 'sh', and for pitchers it is a factor times bfp, since 
'sh' is not available for pitchers.

Future enhancements the factor for sac bunt attempts s/b varied by league. Could be stored in the 
league record and so vary it by leagure ans year. Could store in CF_LeagueStats along with complPct.

1907.04
Revamped for using actual pa and bfp.

7/10'19
The iPhone version of the Ewb site is implemented, along with a modified top-level page. 
And the iPhone version of the help page is implemented.

1907.02
Introduced credibility constants in CParamSet.FillBatParas and in .FillPitParas.

1907.01
Fixed so msg that you must fix defence, it still enabled Play.

6/30'19
It now reads team data from the Internet.
I revamped error handling.


1906.05
Changes to read team data from Web.


6/28'19
Started to make changes for reading teams from Web i/o packaged with app.
I just started. Modified GetLeaguesList only. (Also utility fn to return a string reader).
So if you need to restore, just that one thing to back out (and the orig is there, commented.)


6/27'19
Implimented OpionsPage and AboutPage.
STATUS: Works good on both platforms.


6/26'19
PlaysPage implemented.
Corrected a bug that is in the iPad version, where after saying you can't steal
or you can't sacrifice, then cmdGo is disabled so you're stuck.
Solved it by diabling those switch controls in PlaysPage if no base runners.

Reconfigured tool bar menu color scheme and height, so it's black on white.


6/25'19
Set up full main toolbar. 5 buttons.
Tried to use XF Toobar/ToolBarItems but hard to disable them.
STATUS: Runs on iOS & Android but missing Plays, Options, Help/About.
NEXT: Implement Plays page. 


6/20'19
I have made the changes to streamkine the lineup card flow, eleimunated
cmdDoIt... it's replaced with a DisplayAlart(Yes/No). And the confirmation
DisplayAlert is removed (user can just see the change).
This seems to work good, but NEEDS TESTING! (Try it on iOS.)


6/20'19
I plan now to streamline the lineupcard process, eliminate cmdDoIt and just have a 
DisplayAlert with the proposed change. Wish me luck.


6/19'19
All the subs actions are coded, incl Replace and Change Posn. Needs debugging, a few 
glitches (w/ dh, etc.)
STATUS: Running, but needs debugging.


6/18'19
I overhauled the MainScreen's Appearing handler, using the new 'returningFrom' property, so
that there can be separate logic for each page being returned from. (In Bcxb_Ios you have separate 
'ReturningFrom...' so you don't have this problem.)

So for this I removed 'NeedsScreenRefresh' as being the wrong approach.


--1906.04 (Removed)
Added new property of CGame, 'NeedsScreenRefresh'. If this is true, then in
MainScreen it calls InitBatter().


6/11'19
LineupCard in process


--1906.03 
Added new properties to CLineUpCard: TeamNickVis, TeamNickHome.
This is for labels on tabs on LineupCardPage 


6/6'19
Imlimented CTextToSpeach through the Xamarin dependency service. See code tag -1906.01
This is a good working snapshot. BACKED UP AS "BcxbXf_b1@190608 - next lineup card"

Next: LineupCard and substitution.
First step will be: do lineup card prototype, then decide how much goes on the same page
or on separate pages (buttons, etc.)


6/4'19
Implimented profile disks w/ SkiaSharp. Working.


6/3'19
Rebuilding done -- clean compile with ProfileDisk2Page and
GProfileDisks.


6/3'19
Had to rebuild ProfileDiskPage (now called ProfileDisk2Page) due
to problem re 'InitializeComponent' not found. 
I am in process of this rebuild.
(The x:class pointed to an bogus class name -- this perhaps was
the problem).


5/30'19
In process: ProfileDisks & SkiaSharp

5/23-24'19
Box scores working, buttons for Home/Vis with nicknames.
Tested OK on IOS.


5/17'19
Main screen and Pick Teams working on iOS and Android.
Out balls were a problem on iOS with case sensitivity, but got it fixed.
Next: Box scores: What to use?


5/16'19 (On Tpd2)
I resolved scaling of main page by using all relative vertical sizing.
MenuItems converted to buttons so can be disabled (short of implementing Command objects).
I got many UI event handlers working, mainly show runners, linescore, out balls.
Tested on Android only Must now try on iOS.


5/14'19 (On XPS2)
Filding and runner fields on the diamond.
Now: Will test if its working.


5/13'19
Linescore in white on black with 1px deviders,
Runs good on iOS and Android!
Next: Add fielding names to the diamond, and batters & runners.


5/13'19
Running on iOS and Android, with minimal screen controls: menu bar,diamond, play-by-play, "Play" button.
Next:
1. Add a grid to the main screen?
2. Add line scrore as a 2x18 (or so) grid.


5/7'19
Got the diamond on the screen -- using AbsoluteLayout.
Must now add the linescrore as a 2 30 (or whatever grid),
And make the main page a 1 column grid with "rws" for linescore, 
diamond & outs, play-by-play, and main button. Use *'s to size.


5/5'19
PickTeams working.
Overhauled so on new game, it holds ref to PickTeams to see what was picked.
Next will be: flush out MainScreen w/ images, line score etc.


5/1'19
It runs and plays the game.
Just main screen.
Will next add PickTeamsPage.
